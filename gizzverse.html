                    <p>"[Our albums] all exist in this parallel universe and they maybe from different times and different places
                        but they all can <u>co-exist in a meaningful way.</u>" - Stu Mackenzie</p>
                    <p>So, what is this so called universe called? The dedicated fan base of King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard have come up with a popular fan theory
                       that all begun many years ago on a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> forum where fans alike are tying together the strings of all of the bands songs into one massive
                       shared universe to create one long intertwined musical experience. This universe goes by <strong>The Gizzverse.</strong></p>
                    <p>The Gizzverse has complete freedom for the fans to create their own narrative/universes with the order and choice of songs they pick from,
                       as there is no offical timeline of songs. So hardcore fans step up and share their Gizzverses for others to explore and share.</p>
                    <p>The most beginner friendly Gizzverse for people to get into before infesting down the magical rabbit hole that Gizzard has to offer,
                       is a Gizzverse that focuses on four albums that act as the core of the unvierse, you will be able to connect the four by just their
                       album arts, as seen below.

                    <p>As you can see in the album covers provided, they all share a common place in this so called Gizzverse, and that is the castle that sits atop
                       of the jagged rocky mountain. In numberous songs in the <strong>I'm in Your Mind Fuzz</strong> album, there are prisioners who sing and share a story
                       about the world that is going on outside the castle walls, whilst being controlled by evil lords - The Red Devils on the cover,
                       one of the lords is also mentioned in the <strong>Murder of the Universe</strong> album too. They are beings that wield complete control of humans and adapt
                       infinite power to overcome all their obstacles.</p>
                    <p>This power of the Lords are explained by a certain blind character in the <strong>I'm In Your Mind Fuzz</strong>. also seen on the cover art for <strong>Polygondwanaland</strong>
                       on the bottom left behind bars, which represents he is a prisioner. He speaks of this 'forth colour' and those that see it will wield the powers
                       of a evil lord. If you really focus on the cover of <strong>Polygondwanaland</strong>, you can see the four colours on the right side of the artwork, with the forth
                       no actually being visible to us, as it is meant to represent a colour no human could ever imagine.</p>
                    <p>Another recurring character throughout the Gizzverse and other Gizzard songs, is a character called <em>Han-Tyumi</em> which is humanity but all jumbled up.</p>
                    <img src="assets/images/han.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Han-Tyumi">
                    <p><em>Diagram of Han-Tyumi explained</em></p>
                    <p>He is extremely important as he is meant to be the last known human that has transformed himself into a cyborg, as the human race has come to an end,
                       and the only way humans will survive is to adapt and envolve to survive the new habitats.</p>
                    <p>Han himself, later on becomes the <strong>Murder of the Universe</strong>.</p>
